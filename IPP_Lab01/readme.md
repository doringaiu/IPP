### Prototyping

In this laboratory work I created a simple oAuth service prototype using python programming language.

The future application will be able to respond to all the 3 mentioned requests like register, login or get last user login time and save the data in a database but here we just did a simulation of that because we don't run a real server.

I had some difficulties because login user request input data for example contains a field called user which is not specified in the register input. Also the login user request does not require a password which seems odd.

#### How to run the application
Execute the main.py

#### Features to add
- Implement a web server
- Create a database
- Hash the data using SHA1
- Limit the number of login attempts
- Define database access to resource authority

####Conclusion: 
By performing this laboratory work we learned about the importance of the prototyping. This proccess helps us to better understand how the future application would look like and what features will it have. Also at this step we learn about difficulties of development process and we get a better understanding of what resources do we need to implement the application.
